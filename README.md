# Simple-Tensorflow-Lite-in-Flutter

A simple project where I created a very basic model with Tensorflow's Keras, converted in to Tensorflow Lite, and then got it to run natively on IOS and Android through Flutter.

# Model Generation
To see the model generation script and explanation, go to `./model_generation`.

# Flutter App
